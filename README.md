## JesusGeeks: people doing marvelous things with code and technology (for Christ). 

# about
## JesusGeeks is facilitates discipleship and fellowship for coders and Christian creatives of faith in Christ Jesus. Whether a coding novice or one who constantly seeks to master his or her craft, we will explore programming languages, software and other technologies via activities such as short courses, demo days, sprint/hackathons and retreats all aimed at personal growth and contribution to NYC and the global community. 

# activities
## Fancy making a charity app— while touring London? Looking to design your first smart watch dinner-bot? Perhaps you want to learn how to use APIs and libraries to create a map that beautifully visualizes all left-handed people with pet deer north of Times Square (in real time)? 

# audience
## Whether you are new to coding or you seek to surround yourself with like-spirited folks who will help you  grow in Christ and code, JesusGeeks has something for you! 

# culture
## We offer a safe, welcoming environment to develop your best geeky self. We won’t get into flame wars over languages, operating systems, platforms or which part of the stack (toolset) to develop for. JesusGeeks will encourage you to learn and grow against yourself at your own pace. 

# schedule
## On designated days, we gather for challenges, brainstorming and sprints/hackathons where you can collaborate on new and existing projects, participate in open office hours and show your stuff. 

# other stuff
## We will also announce partnerships and opportunities that connect the greater community in Christ. 

## Be on the lookout for meeting details and announcements posted by midweek. We use GroupVitals, Slack, email and text. No spam, just relevant information. 

# preparation
## To get the most out of the experience, please bring your Bible or Bible app, enthusiasm, curiosity and a fully charged laptop that runs either MacOS, Windows 10 or Linux.

# remember:
**You are loved!**

**-Jesus and JesusGeeks**
